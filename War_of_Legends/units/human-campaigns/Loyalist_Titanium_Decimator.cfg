    description= _ "Iron Maulers were given their name for obvious justifications but, exceptional members of their rank are promoted to more prominence. Often found to serve as the bodyguards of kings emperors, or even lords, the Titanium Decimators are seldom sighted on the battlefield as they menacing slow in terms of mobility. However, if one is ever sighted on the battlefield, slowly advancing in its unstoppable path, then a potential adversary's most beneficial move would be to withdraw from the battle and flee in utmost humiliation. This is because the Titanium Decimator is capable of dealing deathly blows with a single strike of its weapon and are known to fight superbly better in situations where they are outnumbered."
