'- Hogene, I often thank the Gods that the biggest Ragers are so very rare.
- Are they so much more dangerous than the other unnatural denizens of the forest, my Lord?
- Well, they kill you honestly, which is more than you can say for most. But the bloody smears they leave in their wake haunt my dreams.'"#
