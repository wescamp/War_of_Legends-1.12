This is a document where I have written the ideas I had for the Southerners faction, which is momentarily unbalanced.

Faction name stays the same.

Rename the southern elf race to 'desert elf.' Southern Elf was too long.

Units:

Level 1              Level 2                   Level 3

Desert Hunter -->    Desert Warrior   -->      Desert Champion/Swordsmaster/Elite Warrior
             \-->    Desert Chieftain -->      Desert Great Chieftain

Desert Archer -->    Desert Marksman  -->      Desert Sharpshooter

Desert Guardsman --> Desert Sentinel

Carapace -->         Gallant Carapace -->      Warrior Carapace

Dust Devil
(custom advancements)

             /-->    Desert Druid ->(Optional) Desert Empyrean Sylph
Desert Mystic -->    Desert Fire Priestess --> Desert Fire Sorceress
             \-->    Desert Ice Priestess  --> Desert Ice Shyde

Faction Info:

It is a coalition of the southern nations of Arkenova, excluding the dwarves, minotaurs, mermen and wood elves. The faction is based on both offensive & defensive tactics, making it capable of standing a fair chance against any faction. Timeline is during the event known as the first Arkenovan War.

Unit Statistics:

All desert elves receive 50% defence in sand and forest terrain and the movement penalty is one. They are slower and more vulnerable in icy/snowy terrain, but more agile and better adapted for cave crawling. The dexterous trait is not available to them, but the traits strong, resilient, intelligent, quick, and healthy are observed. Since they are elves, they have a -10% resistance to arcane damage.
(Discussable attribute: Since the desert elves are adapted to the harsh climate of the barren sands, I was wondering if they could be given a +10% resistance to fire and -10% resistance to cold-based attacks.)

On a side note, I feel that despite being slow, it's kinda strong and rather hard to kill. Should I weaken him?
Another alternative is to replace this unit with the ever so common Merman Fighter/Merman Hunter/Mermaid Initiate
